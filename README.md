# Learning R
Hello! I am Naphtar Impano, a conservation agriculture graduate from Rwanda Institute for Conservation Agriculture (RICA).

I am  a scientist in animal production looking to leverage the R as a tool to reproduce the research output and collaborate with scientist around the globe
My research interests lie in animal nutrition, physiology, pathogenosis of infectious disease, spatial data analysis, epidemiology, and farm sustainability. 

This repository is for learning R fundamentals and advanced topics in R with version control for collaboration and reproducibility. I believe that through practice I will be able to gain insight from data using .

I will be using data set sourced from Kaggle
